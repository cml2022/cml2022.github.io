# Tutorials

#### Lab session 01: Intro to Python and data processing

The goal of the first lab session is to introduce the tools which you can use for basic data processing in Python.
We will use [Google Colab notebooks](https://colab.to/), which allow you to work in a browser, mixing code and description. 

By the end of the session you will be able to:
* work with numerical values in Python;
* store data in data frames;
* apply exploratory data analysis;
* visualize your data.

We will be using, all of which do not require additional software installation on your pc/mac. First tutorial will be on Introduction to Python Notebook: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CQjRJcQeauaUaZ3kAI-t0ScSqbuR_Cse?usp=sharing)

#### Lab session 02: Intro to Python (Contd.)

The goal of the second lab session is to introduce the  

By the end of the session you will be able to:
* working knowledge of
    * strings;
    * lists;
    * dictionaries;

Second tutorial will be on Introduction to Python (Contd.) Notebook: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17jn_EnI9uHbIB_kinkbweqOfZbRk61dj?usp=sharing)

# Intro to Python

There won't be a separate session with a detailed introduction to Python basics. If you have little or no experience in Python, you could check a free [Python course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) from Kaggle. It has a great combination of useful theoretical materials and practical tasks. It should be enough to get used to Python.

If you already have some experience with Python but would like to have some notes at hand to use for reference, you can check this website [Python cheatsheet][cheatsheet].

If you still have some questions, do not hesitate to contact Utku or Karahan (e-mail subject = "CML: Python intro"). You will get as much help as you need. Don't worry about it!
