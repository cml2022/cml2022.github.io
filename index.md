This is the course page
for the spring 2022 edition of the course
computational methods in linguistics (CML)
at the [Department of Linguistics][lingdept],
[Bogazici University][boun].
Please check [_**practice questons**_](practice), they will be updated 

## Introduction

This course is an introduction to the field of computational linguistics. 
Throughout the semester, we will analyze human language as a computational device, 
discuss some of the major theoretical aspects of computational linguistics, 
and implement practical applications of these theories in Python. 
The intended audience for this course is students with some background in linguistics 
but not much experience in computational methods or programming.
The [schedule](schedule) includes for more information
on the topics and course material.

Course Goals:
(i) Analyzing natural language from a computational perspective,
(ii) Understanding some of the major symbolic and non-symbolic approaches in computational linguistics,
(iii) Applying some computational technology (i.e. nlp techniques) to natural language,
and (iv) Learning some Python to do basic text processing.
See the course [syllabus](files/syllabus.pdf) for further details.
